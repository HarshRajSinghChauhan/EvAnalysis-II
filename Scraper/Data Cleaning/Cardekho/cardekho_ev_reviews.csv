Powerful And Tech Loaded BYD Sealion
The Sealion 7 will surely be an amazing electric SUV. I am really excited about the advanced tech that it offers like the ADAS level 2. Coming with a price tag Rs 45 lakh, it is a premium offering, but with that big and powerful 230 kW motor and best in class luxury features, it feels worth it. I cant wait for the test drive.

New BYD Sealion
I have been keeping an eye on BYD cars and the Sealion 7 looks stunning. With estimate driving range of 483 km and 309 bhp of power sounds like an amazing combination. Plus, the 15.6-inch rotating screen and 9 airbags make it a perfect mix of tech and safety. BYD is definitely raising the bar with this fantastic car. Cant wait to drive it soon.
