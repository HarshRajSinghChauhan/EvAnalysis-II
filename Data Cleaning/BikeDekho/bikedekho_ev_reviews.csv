ATHER,450x,"I have been riding the scrambler 400x for a while now, and overall, it's been a rewarding experience. The bike has a strong person in its retro modern design, and it definitely turns heads. They build quality field premium, which is something you should expect from Triumph, and the finish of the tank and the body is top notch. Performance wise, the 398CC Single cylinder engine packs decent punch. It's smooth and refined and has enough grunt for both city and light off-road. Suspension and tires are made for light off-road ride. But yeah, Indian roads are actually light off-road, so it's the best. Only complaint I have noticed is. Cons. 1. A noticeable engine shim noise issue that has nothing to do with the bike but still irritates while riding. Also spoken with the brand they said it's normal. But not something that we can expect from a brand like Triumph. 2. Indicators and Tail Tidy feels very low quality. Indicators got water intake while raining or washing, within days of purchase. Also indicators faded within months. Even a small hit or the pillion foot is enough for the indicators to break. Excluding these cons, one of the best budget premium scrambler ever in the segment.",

BAJAJ,chetak-2903,"Bought this bike 6 months ago and done almost 9000km and the bike is running smooth did a little little bit of modification to exhaust now it sounds better than the re650‚Äôs. Good performance, very comfortable mileage is not good but enough for a 650cc motorcycle, if anyone is looking for re 650 i would recommend do take a test ride of goldstar you will not regret",
BAJAJ,chetak-2903,"I have been riding the scrambler 400x for a while now, and overall, it's been a rewarding experience. The bike has a strong person in its retro modern design, and it definitely turns heads. They build quality field premium, which is something you should expect from Triumph, and the finish of the tank and the body is top notch. Performance wise, the 398CC Single cylinder engine packs decent punch. It's smooth and refined and has enough grunt for both city and light off-road. Suspension and tires are made for light off-road ride. But yeah, Indian roads are actually light off-road, so it's the best. Only complaint I have noticed is. Cons. 1. A noticeable engine shim noise issue that has nothing to do with the bike but still irritates while riding. Also spoken with the brand they said it's normal. But not something that we can expect from a brand like Triumph. 2. Indicators and Tail Tidy feels very low quality. Indicators got water intake while raining or washing, within days of purchase. Also indicators faded within months. Even a small hit or the pillion foot is enough for the indicators to break. Excluding these cons, one of the best budget premium scrambler ever in the segment.",

Suspension and tires are made for light off-road ride. But yeah, Indian roads are actually light off-road, so it's the best. Only complaint I have noticed is. Cons. 1. A noticeable engine shim noise issue that has nothing to do with the bike but still irritates while riding. Also spoken with the brand they said it's normal. But not something that we can expect from a brand like Triumph. 2. Indicators and Tail Tidy feels very low quality. Indicators got water intake while raining or washing, within days of purchase.

OLA ELECTRIC,s1-air,"I have been riding the scrambler 400x for a while now, and overall, it's been a rewarding experience. The bike has a strong person in its retro modern design, and it definitely turns heads. They build quality field premium, which is something you should expect from Triumph, and the finish of the tank and the body is top notch. Performance wise, the 398CC Single cylinder engine packs decent punch. It's smooth and refined and has enough grunt for both city and light off-road. Suspension and tires are made for light off-road ride. But yeah, Indian roads are actually light off-road, so it's the best. Only complaint I have noticed is. Cons. 1. A noticeable engine shim noise issue that has nothing to do with the bike but still irritates while riding. Also spoken with the brand they said it's normal. But not something that we can expect from a brand like Triumph. 2. Indicators and Tail Tidy feels very low quality. Indicators got water intake while raining or washing, within days of purchase. Also indicators faded within months. Even a small hit or the pillion foot is enough for the indicators to break. Excluding these cons, one of the best budget premium scrambler ever in the segment.",

OLA ELECTRIC,s1-z,"I have been riding the scrambler 400x for a while now, and overall, it's been a rewarding experience. The bike has a strong person in its retro modern design, and it definitely turns heads. They build quality field premium, which is something you should expect from Triumph, and the finish of the tank and the body is top notch. Performance wise, the 398CC Single cylinder engine packs decent punch. It's smooth and refined and has enough grunt for both city and light off-road. Suspension and tires are made for light off-road ride. But yeah, Indian roads are actually light off-road, so it's the best. Only complaint I have noticed is. Cons. 1. A noticeable engine shim noise issue that has nothing to do with the bike but still irritates while riding. Also spoken with the brand they said it's normal. But not something that we can expect from a brand like Triumph. 2. Indicators and Tail Tidy feels very low quality. Indicators got water intake while raining or washing, within days of purchase. Also indicators faded within months. Even a small hit or the pillion foot is enough for the indicators to break. Excluding these cons, one of the best budget premium scrambler ever in the segment.",

OLA ELECTRIC,roadster-pro,"I have been riding the scrambler 400x for a while now, and overall, it's been a rewarding experience. The bike has a strong person in its retro modern design, and it definitely turns heads. They build quality field premium, which is something you should expect from Triumph, and the finish of the tank and the body is top notch. Performance wise, the 398CC Single cylinder engine packs decent punch. It's smooth and refined and has enough grunt for both city and light off-road. Suspension and tires are made for light off-road ride. But yeah, Indian roads are actually light off-road, so it's the best. Only complaint I have noticed is. Cons. 1. A noticeable engine shim noise issue that has nothing to do with the bike but still irritates while riding. Also spoken with the brand they said it's normal. But not something that we can expect from a brand like Triumph. 2. Indicators and Tail Tidy feels very low quality. Indicators got water intake while raining or washing, within days of purchase. Also indicators faded within months. Even a small hit or the pillion foot is enough for the indicators to break. Excluding these cons, one of the best budget premium scrambler ever in the segment.",

TVS Motors,iqube-st,"I have been riding the scrambler 400x for a while now, and overall, it's been a rewarding experience. The bike has a strong person in its retro modern design, and it definitely turns heads. They build quality field premium, which is something you should expect from Triumph, and the finish of the tank and the body is top notch. Performance wise, the 398CC Single cylinder engine packs decent punch. It's smooth and refined and has enough grunt for both city and light off-road. Suspension and tires are made for light off-road ride. But yeah, Indian roads are actually light off-road, so it's the best. Only complaint I have noticed is. Cons. 1. A noticeable engine shim noise issue that has nothing to do with the bike but still irritates while riding. Also spoken with the brand they said it's normal. But not something that we can expect from a brand like Triumph. 2. Indicators and Tail Tidy feels very low quality. Indicators got water intake while raining or washing, within days of purchase. Also indicators faded within months. Even a small hit or the pillion foot is enough for the indicators to break. Excluding these cons, one of the best budget premium scrambler ever in the segment.",
TVS Motors,iqube-st,this is the superb bike in this price and we can use in daily rutiene and this bike also for long rout as milage is very very good we can trust so i prefer to whose people they want daily routine work like field job and porter and all the daily works they can trust on this bike because we want milage.,
