ATHER,450x,4.7,Ather is really reliable and a well performing bike with his reputation as I have this bike for a long time and till date it has been very reliable with accurate range on screen.
ATHER,450x,3.5,My friend buy this scooter and we use it on a daily basis to travel here and there the scooter is greater it is quite reliable and efficient but the battery has started to drain.
ATHER,450x,5.0,There is no problem in buying the ather 450x because the thing wich is use is full high quality and premium and best ev in the wold . It tel exact milage in the display so that.
ATHER,450x,4.7,Best electric bike. Singe charge gives more milage Han other bike compare to this. I have this bike more than 8month. I recommend this bike to all my friends. I love this bike.
ATHER,450x,4.3,"I bought ather 450x, exactly 2 years ago, in December 2022 Overall experience is good. Till now there are no problems 4 services done, total cost combined of 4 services comes."
ATHER,450x,5.0,"A perfect scooter for daily use, it has good range, charging time is minimal, looks of the scooter is very compact and modern, which makes it the first choice of young users, it."
ATHER,450x,,"I have been riding the scrambler 400x for a while now, and overall, it's been a rewarding experience. The bike has a strong person in its retro modern design, and it definitely turns heads. They build quality field premium, which is something you should expect from Triumph, and the finish of the tank and the body is top notch. Performance wise, the 398CC Single cylinder engine packs decent punch. It's smooth and refined and has enough grunt for both city and light off-road. Suspension and tires are made for light off-road ride. But yeah, Indian roads are actually light off-road, so it's the best. Only complaint I have noticed is. Cons. 1. A noticeable engine shim noise issue that has nothing to do with the bike but still irritates while riding. Also spoken with the brand they said it's normal. But not something that we can expect from a brand like Triumph. 2. Indicators and Tail Tidy feels very low quality. Indicators got water intake while raining or washing, within days of purchase. Also indicators faded within months. Even a small hit or the pillion foot is enough for the indicators to break. Excluding these cons, one of the best budget premium scrambler ever in the segment."
ATHER,450x,,this is the superb bike in this price and we can use in daily rutiene and this bike also for long rout as milage is very very good we can trust so i prefer to whose people they want daily routine work like field job and porter and all the daily works they can trust on this bike because we want milage.

BAJAJ,chetak-2903,,"I have been riding the scrambler 400x for a while now, and overall, it's been a rewarding experience. The bike has a strong person in its retro modern design, and it definitely turns heads. They build quality field premium, which is something you should expect from Triumph, and the finish of the tank and the body is top notch. Performance wise, the 398CC Single cylinder engine packs decent punch. It's smooth and refined and has enough grunt for both city and light off-road. Suspension and tires are made for light off-road ride. But yeah, Indian roads are actually light off-road, so it's the best. Only complaint I have noticed is. Cons. 1. A noticeable engine shim noise issue that has nothing to do with the bike but still irritates while riding. Also spoken with the brand they said it's normal. But not something that we can expect from a brand like Triumph. 2. Indicators and Tail Tidy feels very low quality. Indicators got water intake while raining or washing, within days of purchase. Also indicators faded within months. Even a small hit or the pillion foot is enough for the indicators to break. Excluding these cons, one of the best budget premium scrambler ever in the segment."

Performance wise, the 398CC Single cylinder engine packs decent punch. It's smooth and refined and has enough grunt for both city and light off-road. Suspension and tires are made for light off-road ride. But yeah, Indian roads are actually light off-road, so it's the best. Only complaint I have noticed is. Cons. 1. A noticeable engine shim noise issue that has nothing to do with the bike but still irritates while riding. Also spoken with the brand they said it's normal. But not something that we can expect from a brand like Triumph. 2. Indicators and Tail Tidy feels very low quality. Indicators got water intake while raining or washing, within days of purchase. Also indicators faded within months. Even a small hit or the pillion foot is enough for the indicators to break. Excluding these cons, one of the best budget premium scrambler ever in the segment."

The bike has a strong person in its retro modern design, and it definitely turns heads. They build quality field premium, which is something you should expect from Triumph, and the finish of the tank and the body is top notch. Performance wise, the 398CC Single cylinder engine packs decent punch. It's smooth and refined and has enough grunt for both city and light off-road. Suspension and tires are made for light off-road ride. But yeah, Indian roads are actually light off-road, so it's the best. Only complaint I have noticed is. Cons. 1. A noticeable engine shim noise issue that has nothing to do with the bike but still irritates while riding. Also spoken with the brand they said it's normal. But not something that we can expect from a brand like Triumph. 2. Indicators and Tail Tidy feels very low quality. Indicators got water intake while raining or washing, within days of purchase. Also indicators faded within months. Even a small hit or the pillion foot is enough for the indicators to break. Excluding these cons, one of the best budget premium scrambler ever in the segment."

The bike has a strong person in its retro modern design, and it definitely turns heads. They build quality field premium, which is something you should expect from Triumph, and the finish of the tank and the body is top notch. Performance wise, the 398CC Single cylinder engine packs decent punch. It's smooth and refined and has enough grunt for both city and light off-road. Suspension and tires are made for light off-road ride. But yeah, Indian roads are actually light off-road, so it's the best. Only complaint I have noticed is. Cons. 1. A noticeable engine shim noise issue that has nothing to do with the bike but still irritates while riding. Also spoken with the brand they said it's normal. But not something that we can expect from a brand like Triumph. 2. Indicators and Tail Tidy feels very low quality. Indicators got water intake while raining or washing, within days of purchase. Also indicators faded within months. Even a small hit or the pillion foot is enough for the indicators to break. Excluding these cons, one of the best budget premium scrambler ever in the segment."

TVS Motors,iqube-s,,"Bought this bike 6 months ago and done almost 9000km and the bike is running smooth did a little little bit of modification to exhaust now it sounds better than the re650‚Äôs. Good performance, very comfortable mileage is not good but enough for a 650cc motorcycle, if anyone is looking for re 650 i would recommend do take a test ride of goldstar you will not regret"
TVS Motors,iqube-s,,"I have been riding the scrambler 400x for a while now, and overall, it's been a rewarding experience. The bike has a strong person in its retro modern design, and it definitely turns heads. They build quality field premium, which is something you should expect from Triumph, and the finish of the tank and the body is top notch. Performance wise, the 398CC Single cylinder engine packs decent punch. It's smooth and refined and has enough grunt for both city and light off-road. Suspension and tires are made for light off-road ride. But yeah, Indian roads are actually light off-road, so it's the best. Only complaint I have noticed is. Cons. 1. A noticeable engine shim noise issue that has nothing to do with the bike but still irritates while riding. Also spoken with the brand they said it's normal. But not something that we can expect from a brand like Triumph. 2. Indicators and Tail Tidy feels very low quality. Indicators got water intake while raining or washing, within days of purchase. Also indicators faded within months. Even a small hit or the pillion foot is enough for the indicators to break. Excluding these cons, one of the best budget premium scrambler ever in the segment."
